# Description
In this repository, I made lab 1 for ads by using function and recursion
#promblem 1
In this problem, I wrote a code in which the function returns the minimum of them. In this code I have a function findMin(int[] arr, int n).
@ findMin- a set of statements that calculates minimum of given array
@ arr - array of elements where need to find minimum
@ n - size of an array
@ return - in base case, it returns first element of array, in recursive case, it returns minimum of function with using recursion
#problem 2
In this problem, I wrote a code in which the function returns the average of them. In this code I have a function findAverage(int[] arr, int n).
@ findAverage - a set of statements that calculates average of given array
@ arr - array of elements where need to find average of them
@ n - size of an array
@ return - in base case, it returns , in recursive case, it returns minimum of function with using recursion
#problem 3
In this problem, I wrote a code where the function checks a given number prime or composite. In this cose I have a function primeOrComposite(int n, int m)
@ primeOrComposite - a set of statements that check is a given number prime or composite
@ n - given number
@ m - checks the given number for even or odd
@ return - in base case it returns "prime if m=1, in second base case it returns "composite", if n is divisible by m without remainder, in recursive case it returns
